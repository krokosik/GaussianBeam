	Relative waist position
	Customize table columns
	Lens selection
	Sensitivity graph
	Lens movement magnification -> multiple views
	Telescope lens lock
	Print
	Better Wavelength to RGB function
	Forbidden area
	Diaphragme
	Relative distances on graph
	Better hyperbola interpolation
	Export graph & tables to text data
	Optical cavities, eigen mode and stability.
	Waist relative to selection
	Wavefront on graph
	Tune the number of significative digits in editors
	grid
	when moving an optics, display the optics position
	make unit tests for saving/loading
	undo framework
	reimplement paint items in view for optics painting in scene coordinates
	Thick lens, thermal lens
	Conjugate gradient for magic waist

BUGS:
	Loading and saving does not work
	Check that the waist translation by a dielectric slab is right
	Removing an optics does not work
	Relative lock selection does not work anymore
	Check initial values (e.g. magic waist)
	implement ruller scale
	fit problem: some fits are plainly wrong
	change all parameters (e.g. fit result) when changing the wavelength

CONSTANT VIGILENCE:
	Check that the save command saves all parameters & optics
	Translations
	Pedantic
	Valgrind
	API documentation
	check that .c_str() stl strings are enclosed in a QString::fromUtf8
