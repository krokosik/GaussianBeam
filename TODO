WISHLIST:
	Relative waist position
	Lens selection
	Sensitivity graph
	Lens movement magnification -> multiple views
	Telescope lens lock
	Print
	Forbidden area
	Diaphragme
	Relative distances on graph
	Export graph & tables to text data
	Optical cavities, eigen mode and stability.
	Waist relative to selection
	Wavefront on graph
	Tune the number of significative digits in editors and delegates
	grid
	when moving an optics, display the optics position
	make unit tests for saving/loading
	undo framework / file modified
	reimplement paint items in view for optics painting in scene coordinates
	Thick lens, thermal lens
	Camera interfaces
	Set view limits to bench limits button
	TEMmn modes
	more intrication between opticsbench bounds and view bounds
	Warn when closing a modified file + modified status in window title
	New drawing for cylindrical lenses on the non lensing side
	Scripting
	Unittest

BUGS:
	Sometimes, beams disappear
	Ellipsoidal fit
	Removing a fit does not remove it from the scene
	Hide lock button when there is only one scene
	Don't allow for optics to exit the optical bench
	Zoom full should only focus on the horizontal direction for 1D benches
	Optics ID is strange in GaussianBeam 0.4
	Check at which version we moved from name to id to lock
	Deal with optics ID in XSLT
	Problems when adding and removing fits: some are mysteriously disappearing
	Problem with n > 1 and target beam
	Problem in redraw when deleting an optics with non zero width
	Implement ruller scale & vertical labels
	Update all data when chaging the delegate
	Really find local optimum, not 100% local optimum
	Angle is editable even for non rotable optics
	Save all views information
	Check that the initial waist position is well loaded from old files (optics position -> beam position)
	Lock views does not work
	Last Optics name wrong hen loading a file

CONSTANT VIGILENCE:
	change all parameters when changing the wavelength
	Check initial values
	Check that the save command saves all parameters & optics
	Translations
	Pedantic
	Valgrind
	API documentation
	check that .c_str() stl strings are enclosed in a QString::fromUtf8
	check const functions
	check that the program starts without settings
